 AWS Assignment Day-3


Task 1

Create a linux t2.micro ec2 instance. After logging into this instance move /etc/sudoers file with /etc/sudoers.bkp


Now try to login, If can't - resolve this issue


Task 2

create an ansible role before pushing the same to your public github repository.


This Role will simply host an nginx webpage saying

Execute this role in user data script while launching another instance


Your website should be up & running after the system boots up


tag this instance as ninja:yourname


Task 3

Task1:  
* Start a other Debug Linux Instance.  
* Make sure that it is running in the same Availability Zone as the sacrificial server.  
* Fix the bad Server:  
* Stop but do not terminate the bad server, detach bad server root drive and attach it to debug server,  
* then mount its root disk drive as a normal data drive on the debug server, to get access to the sudoer file.   
* Rename sudoers.bkp to sudoers. 
 

```
 $ cd /
 $ sudo mkdir bad
 $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf /bad 
```
```
 $ cd /bad
 $ ls 
```
* sudo mv /etc/sudoers.bkp /etc/sudoers  

* Detach EBS from debug server and attach it again to bad server.  

Start bad server and login... BANG....it works!!!
