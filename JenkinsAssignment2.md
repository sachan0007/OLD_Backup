##ArtifactBuilder:
I have used last maven project as "ArtifactBuilder" and to archive artifacts
Configure few changes in maven job.

Source code mgmt and Build section are as were before to create .war 
Post-build Actions:-
Archive the artifacts- target/Spring3HibernateApp.war (artifact we want to archive)
